    <p>
        My name is Joseph Mitchell, and I am a graduate of Edinburgh Napier University with a First Class Honours in BSc Games Development. 
        Throughout my education I have had experience not only with many aspects of Software Engineering and Development, but also in the creative side of Games Dev. 
        Some of my college and university projects are available from the link above, although I am still in the process of adding them.<br>
        Currently I am looking to join a development team where I can utilize the skills I have learned from my education in the real world.<br>
        I also occasionally spend time working on my own personal projects. You can see what I am currently working on in the section below.
