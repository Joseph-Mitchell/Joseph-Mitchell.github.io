<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
    This was the final coursework for a college module made to teach us how to design levels in a 3D environment.
    Apart from learning level design concepts we also had to learn the basics of how to use <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/">Unreal Engine</a>, such as simple modeling, texturing and scripting.
    The level is relatively short, simply sending the player through a small underground facility and solving some simple puzzles before heading back to the surface.

<h2>Level Flow</h2>
<p>
    The player begins in the starting room and walks through the hallway ahead to the elevator room. The elevator will take the player down to floor -1. The player will have to take the elevator again down to
    floor -2 to find the code on the floor in the first room. Using the elevator once more will take the player back to floor -1, where they will open a door using the code they found to unlock the keypad.
    The floor of the hallway through the door will break underneath the player, dropping them back down to a hidden room in floor -2 which contains a button. Pushing the button will open a door back to the elevator
    and call the elevator to their floor. The elevator will now allow the player to go down to floor -3. The player then walks down a small corridor and push some boxes blocking a doorway proceeding into a room
    with a staircase leading to the final floor. A final hallway must be traversed, along which overhead lights will switch on as the player approaches them. At the end of the hallway is a spiral staircase which
    takes the player all the way up to the ground floor and to the final room.
