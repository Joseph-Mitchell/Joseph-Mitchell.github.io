<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
    This was the final coursework for a college module made to teach us how to design levels in a 3D environment.
    Apart from learning level design concepts we also had to learn the basics of how to use Unreal engine, such as simple modeling, texturing and scripting.
    The level is relatively short, simply sending the player through a small underground facility and solving some simple puzzles before heading back to the surface.
