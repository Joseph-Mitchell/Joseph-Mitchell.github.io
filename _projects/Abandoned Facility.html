<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
    This was the final coursework for a college module made to teach us how to design levels in a 3D environment.
    Apart from learning level design concepts we also had to learn the basics of how to use Unreal engine, such as simple modeling, texturing and scripting.
    The level is relatively short, simply sending the player through a small underground facility and solving some simple puzzles before heading back to the surface.

<h3>Level Flow</h3>
<p>
    The player begins in the starting room and walks through the hallway ahead to the elevator room. The elevator will take the player down to floor -1. The player will have to take the elevator again down to
    floor -2 to find the code on the floor in the first room. Using the elevator once more will take the player back to floor -1, where they will open a door using the code they found to unlock the keypad.
    The floor of the hallway through the door will break underneath the player, dropping them back down to a hidden room in floor -2 which contains a button. Pushing the button will open a door back to the elevator
    and call the elevator to their floor. The elevator will now allow the player to go down to floor -3. The player then walks down a small corridor and push some boxes blocking a doorway proceeding into a room
    with a staircase leading to the final floor. A final hallway must be traversed, along which overhead lights will switch on as the player approaches them. At the end of the hallway is a spiral staircase which
    takes the player all the way up to the ground floor and to the final room.
