<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
    This was the first piece of coursework I completed for my games development course in college. We had previously created a number of smaller games to specified instructions, 
    but this was the first game we made completely on our own. Part of the task was to pick an old arcade game to replicate, and so I chose to remake the original Donkey Kong. 
    The game itself is made using <a href="https://www.monogame.net/">MonoGame</a>, a .NET framework which provides some basic tools to program a game without being a full game engine itself.
