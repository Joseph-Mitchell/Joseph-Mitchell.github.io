<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
    This project was created as a part of a module from my college Games Development course which was intended to help us showcase our ability to work within a team.
    Apart from putting forward initial proposals as well as helping to create planning documentation, my main role within the team was to create artwork for use outside of the main game,
    mostly consisting of UI art.

<h2>Artwork</h2>
<h3>Menu and End Screen</h3>
<div class="grid" style="grid-template-columns: 50% 50%;">
    <div>
        <img src="{{layout.image_source}}{{page.title}}/1.png">
        <p class="caption">Menu Image</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <img src="{{layout.image_source}}{{page.title}}/2.png">
        <p class="caption">Finish Image</p>
    </div>
</div>
<p>These assets were created fairly simply by hand drawing with brushes in <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html">Adobe Photoshop</a>. Both images were traced from existing stock images with changes such as the prisoner's uniform.</p>
<h3>UI</h3>
<div class="grid" style="grid-template-columns: 50% 50%;">
    <div>
        <img src="{{layout.image_source}}{{page.title}}/3.png">
        <p class="caption">Main Menu UI</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <img src="{{layout.image_source}}{{page.title}}/4.png">
        <p class="caption">Pause Menu UI</p>
    </div>
</div>
<img src="{{layout.image_source}}{{page.title}}/5.png" style="width: 75%">
<p class="caption">Inventory UI</p>
<p>These assets were created using Photoshop techniques such as patterns and layer effects.</p>
