<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
    This project was the final coursework for the "World Wide Web" module of my Games Development college course.
    We were tasked with creating a website which could allow users to find hidden QR codes and keep track of which codes they had found with a profile on the website.
    The website maroritively uses php and html, with sql used for database operations. It along with its databases were created using <a href="https://www.wampserver.com/">WampServer</a>.
