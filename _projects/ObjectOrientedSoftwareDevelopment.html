<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
    This module's main purpose was to teach us to program in C# with Object Oriented Principals. 
    The module was taught using Windows Presentation Foundation as a framework for programming with and included two coursework projects which required developing programs using the subsystem.
    Along with learning OOP, C# basics and WPF development, there were a number of more complex C# features and programming principals taught during the course of the module.
</p>
<p>
    These learning points were:
    <ul>
    <li>Applications Architecture</li>
    <li>Persistence and Serialization</li>
    <li>Automated Testing</li>
    <li>LINQ Queries</li>
    <li>Software Design Patterns</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h2>Coursework 1</h2>
<p>
    The first coursework was aimed at testing our knowledge of basic WPF functions.
    The required deliverable was a mock-up presentation layer form for a system that takes information for a student (such as their name, the course they are studying, their e-mail etc.).<br>
    The inputs of this form are be passed through a validation method which checks each field for errors (e.g. no @ symbol in e-mail, empty fields, unselected dropdown boxes).
    If an error is found, a pop-up box is opened describing the issue. If no errors are found a pop up box shows a validation message.
</p>
<p>
    Below is a showcase of the form and pop-up layouts along with relevant code snippets.

<h2>Coursework 2</h2>
<p>
    For the second coursework we were tasked with creating a mock-up of a system made for an organization providing support services to elderly patients. 
    This system was required to handle the information of staff and clients and to provide framework for the scheduling of client visitations.<br>
    We were provided with a premade "presentation layer" consisting of a WPF form layout, along with a "business layer" with empty methods to be called by the presentation layer once they had been completed.<br>
</p>
<p>
    Below is the premade form layout given for the coursework.
</p>
<img src="{{layout.image_source}}{{page.title}}/4.png">
<p>
    The functionalities of each button are as follows:
    <ul>
        <li><mark>Add Staff:</mark> Adds a number of staff members to a list in the business layer by calling the addStaff method, before printing the contents of the list with the getStaffList method.</li>
        <li><mark>Add Clients:</mark> Similar functionality to Add Staff, but using the addClient and getClientList functions respectively.</li>
        <li>
            <mark>Add Visits:</mark> Again, similar to the above buttons, with addVisit and getVisitList respectively, with the exception of using try-catch statements for each visit as the
            addVisit method is intended to throw exceptions if incorrectly formatted data is given or if the new visit clashes with pre-existing staff or client schedules.
        </li>
        <li><mark>Save:</mark> Saves held data to a file.</li>
        <li><mark>Clear:</mark> Clears held data.</li>
        <li><mark>Load:</mark> Loads held data from a file.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    The first task for creating the system was to design and impliment the Staff, Client and Visit classes. Below is a class diagram depicting their relationships.
</p>
<img style="width:100%" src="{{layout.image_source}}{{page.title}}/5.png">
<p>
    Each class is held in a new "data layer" as the methods in each class only exist to expose data to the business layer.
</p>
<p>
    The data layer facade holds lists for people and visits and contains methods for: creating new clients, staff and visits; saving, loading and clearing data; and a method for creating a new ID for each visit.<br>
    Each of the classes holds their respective data and has a ToString and Display method.<br>
    The Staff and Client classes inherit from a new People class, as they shared a number of common attributes.<br>
    The Client class in this implimentation is simply an empty class to allow the program to explicitly differentiate clients from staff 
    (although in retrospect this could likely have been done more simply with the use of an enumerator or other identifying variable).<br>
    Finally a new Location class was created to store longitude and latitude location data together.
</p>
<p>
    The methods in each class are self explanitory, however some of the methods in the facade require further context.<br>
    The NewStaff, NewClient and NewVisit methods take data as simple datatypes and calls the constructors of the respective class. 
    This can be done directly for the most part, but some data is parsed from strings to enumerators or DateTime.<br>
    These methods also have a number of exception throwers if data is incorrectly formatted or clashes with existing data.
</p>
<p>Below is the NewStaff method as an example.</p>

{% highlight cs %}
public bool NewStaff(string c, int i, string f, string s, string a1, string a2, double la, double lo)
{
    StaffCategory staffCategory;

    foreach (Staff j in people.OfType<Staff>())
    {
        if (j.ID == i)
        {
            throw new Exception("Error - The id given was already assigned to a staff member in new staff (id " + i + " fname " + f + " sname " + s + ")");
        }
    }

    switch (c)
    {
        case "General Practitioner":
            staffCategory = StaffCategory.GeneralPractitioner;
            break;
        case "Community Nurse":
            staffCategory = StaffCategory.CommunityNurse;
            break;
        case "Social Worker":
            staffCategory = StaffCategory.SocialWorker;
            break;
        case "Care Worker":
            staffCategory = StaffCategory.CareWorker;
            break;
        default:
            throw new Exception("Error - The category given did not exist in new staff (id " + i + " fname " + f + " sname " + s + ")");
    }

    people.Add(new Staff(i, staffCategory, f, s, a1, a2, lo, la));

    return true;
}
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
    The clear method simply clears the people and visits lists, however the save and load methods are more complex.<br>
    The save method uses StreamWriter to save each list to corrosponding csv files, with a separate file for staff and clients. The full method is shown below.
</p>

{% highlight cs %}
public void Save()
{
    using (StreamWriter file = new StreamWriter(SAVEPATH + "staff.csv"))
    {
        file.AutoFlush = true;
        foreach (Staff s in people.OfType<Staff>())
        {
            file.WriteLine(s.ToString());
        }
    }

    using (StreamWriter file = new StreamWriter(SAVEPATH + "clients.csv"))
    {
        file.AutoFlush = true;
        foreach (Client c in people.OfType<Client>())
        {
            file.WriteLine(c.ToString());
        }
    }

    using (StreamWriter file = new StreamWriter(SAVEPATH + "visits.csv"))
    {
        file.AutoFlush = true;
        foreach (Visit v in visits)
        {
            file.WriteLine(v.ToString());
        }
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
    The load method is slightly more convoluted, needing to parse data in the save file and using try-catch statements in case of parsing failure. 
    The try-catch statement for the staff list is shown below.
</p>

{% highlight cs %}
try
{
    using (StreamReader file = new StreamReader(SAVEPATH + "staff.csv"))
    {
        for (string line = file.ReadLine(); line != null; line = file.ReadLine())
        {
            string[] staffAttribs = line.Split(',');

            int id = int.Parse(staffAttribs[0]);
            string firstName = staffAttribs[1];
            string surname = staffAttribs[2];
            string address1 = staffAttribs[3];
            string address2 = staffAttribs[4];
            double longitude = double.Parse(staffAttribs[5]);
            double latitude = double.Parse(staffAttribs[6]);
            StaffCategory category = (StaffCategory)Enum.Parse(typeof(StaffCategory), staffAttribs[7]);

            people.Add(new Staff(id, category, firstName, surname, address1, address2, longitude, latitude));
        }
    }
}
catch
{
    return false;
}
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
    The final task given for this coursework was to create a number of unit tests for a class in the system.
    This was done using a new test project in visual studio which was aimed to test the methods in the DataSingletonFacade class.<br>
    An example of one of these unit tests is given below.
</p>
{% highlight cs %}
[TestMethod]
public void NewStaff_ExistingID_ThrowsException()
{
    string category = "General Practitioner";
    int id = 12;
    string firstName = "John";
    string surname = "Smith";
    string address1 = "17 Laine Lane";
    string address2 = "Taunton";
    double latitude = 12.345678;
    double longitude = 87.654321;

    DataSingletonFacade.Instance.NewStaff(category, id, firstName, surname, address1, address2, latitude, longitude);

    try
    {
        DataSingletonFacade.Instance.NewStaff(category, id, firstName, surname, address1, address2, latitude, longitude);
    }
    catch (Exception e)
    {
        StringAssert.Contains(e.Message, "The id given was already assigned to a staff member", "Unexpected Exception was thrown");
        return;
    }
    Assert.Fail("No exception was thrown");
}
