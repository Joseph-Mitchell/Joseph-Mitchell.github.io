<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
    This project was the final coursework for the "Object Oriented Programming" module of my Games Development college course.
    We were provided a choice of classic games - which had been redesigned with fantasy themes - one of which we would have to recreate with C# and MonoGame using OOP principals.
    I chose to recreate Bomberman, which had been redesigned as wizards dropping exploding cauldrons.
