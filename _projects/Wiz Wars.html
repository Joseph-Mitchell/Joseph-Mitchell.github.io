<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
    This project was the final coursework for the "Object Oriented Programming" module of my Games Development college course.
    We were provided a choice of classic games - which had been redesigned with fantasy themes - one of which we would have to recreate with C# and MonoGame using OOP principals.
    I chose to recreate Bomberman, which had been redesigned as wizards dropping exploding cauldrons.

<h2>Class Structure</h2>

<p>
    The Object Classes create the structural basis for every visible object in the game, ranging through static images (for text, images, UI elements), 
    objects with a hitbox (for objects to be used in game) and ending with the Player class.
</p>
<p>
    The Menu Classes are self explanitory, with a single class for generic menus and a class for each specific menu.
</p>
<p>
    The Map class contains the data for constructing the walls and destructible blocks of the main level.
</p>
<p>
    The Input class handles player input, allowing other classes in the program to reference methods in the Input class rather than expecting specific buttons.
