<h2>Background & Purpose</h2>
<p>
    This was a software challenge during my time at Digital Futures academy. It was given to us in order to test our
    ability to create a full Java program with a set of constraints. The full list of expectations for this challenge
    can be found in the readme of the
    <a href="https://github.com/Joseph-Mitchell/Address-Book-Challenge">GitHub page.</a>
</p>

<h2>Skill-scope</h2>
<p>
    This project demonstrates my ability to:

<ul>
    <li>Consider the benifits and risks of a project.</li>
    <li>Break down a problem into discrete and prioritised tasks.</li>
    <li>Use Object Oriented Design principles in the planning and development of a program.</li>
    <li>Use Test Driven Development practices to manage testing of a program.</li>
    <li>Create programs using Java.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Program Description</h2>
<p>
    The project is a command line application which allows a user to store a number of contacts, similar to a real
    address
    book. Users can navigate the program to display or search through existing contacts, and can also create new
    contacts as
    well as edit or delete existing contacts. Below are screenshots of each submenu of the program.

<h2>Project Planning</h2>
<p>
    For the first stage of planning I separated the problem into the following user stories:

    From these user stories, I worked out the required objects for the program and translated them into a class diagram:
