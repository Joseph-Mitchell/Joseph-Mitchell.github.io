<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
    This project was the final graded coursework for my Games Development college course.
    We were tasked with creating a game in Unity, and included a planning phase, a development phase and a self assesment phase.
</p>
<h2>Planning</h2>
<h3>Game Description</h3>
<p>
    The game was intended to be a 2-D side scrolling truck driving game, in which the player would transport loose objects through a level to recieve a score dependant on the time taken and amount of objects not lost.
    Originally, the game had a small backstory about a girl making a birthday card for her brother, which her brother would deliver craft materials (such as stickers and crayons) for her to make more interesting.
    Once the game was completed, a final part of the story would be revealed, showing that the boys birthday present was a new toy truck, which also set up the unlock for a two player mode.

<h3>Art Style</h3>

<p>
    From early on in the project I decided to use a simple childlike art style which used light pastel colours and was made to appear as if drawn by a child using crayon.
